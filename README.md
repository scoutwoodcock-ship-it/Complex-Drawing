# Complex-Drawing

What did I find fun: I enjoyed mapping out the sketch on paper, and plotting al of the specific points for the diufferent shapes. This allowed em to use math which I like, and made it make sense in my brain before putting it into my code.

What did you find challenging: The biggest piece I found challenging was remembering how to draw each shape, I have to refere back to my notes often, but as I continuesd to work through it the shaoes came easier to me.

What did I learn: I learned that making shapes with code is much easier iuf you plan it all before hand, and writing fown your steos as you go is also easier so you can better visualize your end result and how to complete it efficiently.
